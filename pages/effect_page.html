            <h1>Human Health Impacts</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Air pollution poses serious risks to human health. Inhalation of pollutants
                can cause or worsen respiratory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, and
                chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It can also lead to increased rates
                of lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and other respiratory infections.
                Fine particulate matter and ozone are particularly harmful to human health.
            </p><br>

            <h1>Environmental Degradation</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Air pollution has detrimental effects on the environment. Acid rain, caused
                by the deposition of sulfur and nitrogen compounds from air pollution, damages
                forests, crops, and aquatic life, and deteriorates buildings and infrastructure.
                Additionally, air pollutants contribute to the formation of smog, reducing
                visibility and impacting ecosystems.
            </p><br>

            <h1>Climate Change</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Certain air pollutants, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, are
                greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming and climate change. These
                pollutants trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to rising temperatures,
                altered weather patterns, melting glaciers, sea-level rise, and other adverse
                impacts on ecosystems and human societies.
            </p><br>

            <h1>Economic Consequences</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Air pollution has significant economic implications. The costs associated with
                healthcare expenditures, lost productivity, and premature deaths due to air
                pollution are substantial. Additionally, environmental damage caused by air
                pollution can lead to financial losses in agriculture, tourism, and other
                industries dependent on natural resources and clean environments.
            </p><br>

            <h1>Crop and Forest Damage</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Air pollutants can harm agricultural crops and forests. Ozone, in particular,
                damages plant tissues, reduces crop yields, and affects the growth and
                productivity of forests. This has implications for food security, biodiversity,
                and ecosystem services provided by forests, such as carbon sequestration and
                water regulation.
            </p><br>

            <h1>Impaired Visibility</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Air pollution reduces visibility in urban areas and scenic locations due to the
                presence of particulate matter, smog, and haze. This can diminish the aesthetic
                value of landscapes and cultural heritage sites, impacting tourism and overall
                quantity of life.
