                    Despite the fast growing interest in electric cars, most of the vehicles
                    are powered by gasoline and diesel engines that burn petroleum to release
                    energy. Burning petroleum with enough oxygen should produce nothing worse
                    than carbon dioxide and water. However, in practice, fuels aren't pure 
                    hydrocarbons and engines don't burn them cleanly. As a result, exhausts 
                    from engine contain all kinds of pollution, such as notably particulates, 
                    carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and lead.

                    Renewable energy sources are helping us generate a bigger proportion of our
                    power every year, but the overwhelming majority of electricity is still produced
                    by burning fossil fuels such as coal, gas, and oil, mostly in conventional power
                    plants. Just like car engines, power plants should produce nothing worse than 
                    carbon dioxide and water. However, in practice, fuels are dirty and they don't 
                    burn cleanly, so power plants produce a range of air pollutants, such as notably 
                    sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulates.

                    Factories often release small but significant quantities of pollution into the 
                    air. For example, factories that produce metals such as aluminum and steel, refine 
                    petroleum, produce cement, synthesize plastic, or make other chemicals are among 
                    those that can produce harmful air pollution. Most factories that pollute release 
                    small amounts of pollution continually over a long period of time. However, sometimes 
                    factories can release huge amounts of air pollution accidentally in a very short space 
                    of time.

                    Although traffic, power plants, and factories produce the majority of Earth's outdoor 
                    air pollution, many other factors contribute to the problem too. The causes of indoor 
                    air pollution are very different. Burning solid fuels for cooking and heating produces 
                    indoor air pollution that can seriously harm our health. In some areas, garbage is
                    incinerated instead of being recycled or landfilled and that can also produce significant
                    air pollution unless the incinerators are properly designed.
