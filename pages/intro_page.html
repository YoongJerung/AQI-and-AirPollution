            <h1>What is Air Pollution?</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Air pollution is a gas released in a big enough quantity to harm the health of people or other animals, 
                kill plants or stop them growing properly, damage or disrupt the environment, or cause some nuisance. 
                According to the World Health Organization, around 4.2 million people die prematurely from the effects 
                of polluted, outdoor air every single year, while a further 3.8 million die due to dirty indoor air. Air 
                pollution is a huge problem - and not just for people living in smog-choked cities: through global warming
                and damage to the ozone layer, it has the potential to affect us all.
            </p>
            <p>
                As with water pollution and land contamination, it's the quantity of a chemical in the air that makes the 
                difference between "harmless" and "pollution". Carbon dioxide, for example, is present in the air around 
                you at a typical concentration of less than 0.05% and breathing it in usually does no harm; but air with 
                an extremely high concentration of carbon dioxide is toxic and could kill you in a matter of minutes. Since 
                Earth's atmosphere is very turbulent, air pollution will often disperse relatively quickly so it wouldn't 
                be a problem. The only trouble was, Earth is a much smaller place than we think and pollution doesn't always 
                disappear so conveniently.

                            air pollution on local scale. The causes and effects are close together in both space and time, 
                            and it is the easiest kind to tackle.

                            How clean your air is depends on where you live: air is cleaner in rural than urban areas.
                            Besides, it can also depends critically on the weather. This air pollution are often tackled 
                            through local community campaigns.

                            Air pollution can easily be blown from one continent or country where it's produced and cause 
                            a problem for somewhere else. This kind of air pollution that travels from country to country
                            is known as transboundary pollution.

                            One example of air pollution on global scale is global warming, which is a gradual rising of Earth's 
                            temperature. Unless we tackle the problem soon, it could make the climate more erratic, forcing 
                            species to extinct.
